# Tiled Read-only Api for OSM data - TRAPI

In the early days of OpenStreetMap a crowdsourced rendering system was in use (tiles@home), trapi was used to provide a tiled access to the data for the rendering clients.

This is an attempt to (not fully seriously) inverstigate if this still has use in the modern age as a light-weight read-only data format.
